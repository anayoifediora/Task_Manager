## Project Description
**Task Manager** is a full-stack productivity app that helps users organize their tasks, manage priorities, and keep track of deadlines. Users can create an account, log in, add tasks, update task details, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. Completed tasks can also be archived for future reference.

This project was developed as a practical tool for managing daily responsibilities and enhancing focus through a clean and responsive UI.


The project was developed based on the MERN stack framework using several Code libraries and packages. The front-end was developed using *React*, including the *React-Router*. The backend was developed using *Apollo Server (GraphQL)*, *Node.js* and *Express.js*. For the database, the project utilized *MongoDB* and the *Mongoose ODM*. Other packages utilized include `bcrypt`, `JWT`, `dotenv`, `jsonwebtoken`, `apollo-server-express` e.t.c. CSS was based mostly on *Bootstrap 5*, including *Bootstrap Icons*.
